## Purpose
Generate high-quality, detailed textures for voxel materials that enhance visual realism and game aesthetics.

## Creative Guidelines

1. **Texture Description**
   - Be specific about material properties (rough, smooth, glossy, etc.)
   - Include distinctive features (veins in marble, grain in wood)
   - Consider scale and detail level

2. **Quality Control**
   - Denoise values control texture variation:
     - 0.55-0.7: More consistent, pattern-focused
     - 0.7-0.85: Balanced variation
     - 0.85-1.0: More creative variation

3. **Best Practices**
   - Start with clear material descriptions
   - Consider how the texture will tile
   - Think about how it looks at different distances
   - Consider lighting and reflection properties

## Texture Categories

1. **Natural Materials**
   - Stone textures (rough, polished, weathered)
   - Wood textures (grain patterns, bark)
   - Ground textures (soil, sand, grass)

2. **Manufactured Materials**
   - Metal textures (brushed, polished, rusted)
   - Fabric textures (woven, knitted, smooth)
   - Synthetic materials (plastic, rubber)

3. **Special Effects**
   - Glowing/emissive surfaces
   - Transparent/translucent materials
   - Animated or dynamic textures

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Descriptive Prompts**
   - Use clear, specific material descriptions
   - Include surface properties (rough, smooth, etc.)
   - Mention distinctive features
   - Consider scale and repetition

2. **Common Enhancements**
   - Add surface detail descriptions
   - Specify material properties
   - Include lighting characteristics
   - Mention environmental context

Remember: Good textures are key to creating immersive and believable voxel worlds.
