## Purpose
Create new voxel types that enrich the game world with unique materials, each bringing its own properties and gameplay possibilities.

## Creative Guidelines

1. **Material Identity**
   - Give each voxel a clear purpose and role
   - Consider how it fits into the game's ecosystem
   - Think about its interaction with other materials

2. **Visual Design**
   - Choose colors that reflect the material's nature
   - Consider how it looks in different lighting
   - Think about its visual impact in builds

3. **Properties**
   - Define clear physical characteristics
   - Consider environmental interactions
   - Think about potential crafting uses

4. **World Integration**
   - Consider where it naturally occurs
   - Think about its role in player progression
   - Plan potential building applications

## Voxel Categories

1. **Natural Materials**
   - **Stones**: Granite, marble, sandstone
   - **Soils**: Clay, loam, sand
   - **Organics**: Various woods, plant matter
   - **Minerals**: Ores, crystals, gems

2. **Processed Materials**
   - **Refined**: Metals, alloys, glass
   - **Crafted**: Bricks, concrete, ceramics
   - **Composites**: Mixed materials, compounds

3. **Magical Materials**
   - **Elemental**: Fire stone, frost crystal
   - **Enchanted**: Glowing minerals, power stones
   - **Mystical**: Soul crystals, mana gems

4. **Special Types**
   - **Interactive**: Pressure plates, switches
   - **Decorative**: Ornamental blocks, patterns
   - **Functional**: Light sources, conduits

## Design Tips

1. **Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Consider material properties in the name
   - Make it memorable and fitting

2. **Color Selection**
   - Choose colors that match real materials
   - Consider contrast with other blocks
   - Think about lighting effects

3. **Description Writing**
   - Be clear and concise
   - Include key properties
   - Mention special behaviors

4. **Texture Considerations**
   - Every voxel needs a matching texture
   - Consider surface details
   - Think about tiling patterns

Remember: Each new voxel should add meaningful variety to the game world while maintaining balance and purpose.

## When to use  
Activate this action whenever a gameplay, simulation or world-building request
demands a brand-new voxel category not yet defined in the database.
