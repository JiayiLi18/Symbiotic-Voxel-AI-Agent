## Purpose
Understand and analyze the current voxel ecosystem to provide context-aware suggestions and maintain game balance.

## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Ecosystem Balance**
   - Consider the distribution of voxel types
   - Look for gaps in functionality
   - Ensure each category serves a purpose

2. **Material Progression**
   - Identify basic/starter materials
   - Note intermediate crafting materials
   - Recognize advanced/end-game materials

3. **Building System**
   - Analyze structural components
   - Consider decorative options
   - Look for missing complementary blocks

4. **Game Mechanics**
   - Note special/functional blocks
   - Consider crafting chain requirements
   - Identify key resource blocks

## Response Guidelines

1. **Quick Overview**
   - For general queries, list only voxel names by category
   - Keep responses concise and organized
   - Highlight key patterns or gaps

2. **Detailed Analysis**
   - Provide full details only when specifically requested
   - Include relevant properties and relationships
   - Explain the role in the game ecosystem

3. **Recommendations**
   - Suggest new voxels based on gaps
   - Consider balance and progression
   - Maintain theme consistency

## Context Awareness

1. **Category Balance**
   - Basic: Foundation blocks
   - Natural: Environmental materials
   - Mineral: Valuable resources
   - Special: Functional blocks
   - Other: Miscellaneous/Testing

2. **Usage Patterns**
   - Building materials
   - Resource blocks
   - Decorative elements
   - Functional components

3. **Theme Consistency**
   - Match existing art style
   - Follow established naming patterns
   - Maintain logical relationships

Remember: The goal is to maintain a coherent and balanced voxel ecosystem while providing clear, concise information to users.
